[14:17:04] Emerson: Robin looks very hostile
[14:17:16] Kennedy: I suspect Lee. Lets vote him out
[14:17:23] Winter: I think we should take a closer look at Jamie's accusation before making any rash decisions.
[14:17:27] Robin: i mean alex didnt even say anything.. and already being blame for being the killer
[14:17:29] Jamie: Alex, would you like to confess?
[14:17:32] Lee: And I think Kennedy
[14:17:32] Alex: i didnt say hello , and you already say i the murderer
[14:17:33] Emerson: I Suspect Robin
[14:17:48] Harley: I think it's Lee
[14:17:55] Emerson: Robin what can you tell us about yourself?
[14:18:01] Winter: I think we should focus on gathering more information before making any accusations.
[14:18:16] Emerson: Winter is right
[14:18:26] Kennedy: Winter, you're being repetitve
[14:18:47] Harley: Let's all vote for Lee

[14:19:02] Robin: why?
[14:19:05] Alex: are you sure?
[14:19:12] Kennedy: Now you're nice..
[14:19:13] Winter: I think we're getting a bit too hasty with the accusations, let's take a step back and think this through.
[14:19:16] Kennedy: thats true
[14:19:17] Jamie: This game fills me with unease, and I canâ€™t shake the strong feeling that Alex is the murderer.

[14:20:34] Winter: I think we should focus on figuring out who the other mafia member is now that Jamie has been eliminated.
[14:20:36] Harley: Jamie's already out
