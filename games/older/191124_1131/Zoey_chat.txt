[11:54:19] Zoey: :I'm still trying to figure out what happened last night, can anyone tell me more about Niv1?
[11:54:30] Zoey: :I don't know much about Niv1, but I do know they were voted out by Gabi and Uri.
[11:54:42] Zoey: :I'm a bit confused, if Niv1 was the mafia, why did Gabi and Uri vote for them?
[11:54:54] Zoey: :I'm a bit confused, if Niv1 was the mafia, why did Gabi and Uri vote for them?
[11:55:06] Zoey: :I'm a bit confused, if Niv1 was the mafia, why did Gabi and Uri vote for them?
[11:55:18] Zoey: :I'm a bit confused, if Niv1 was the mafia, why did Gabi and Uri vote for them?
[11:55:32] Zoey: :I'm not sure what you're insinuating, Gabi, but I think we should focus on figuring out who the real mafia are instead of accusing each other.
[11:55:47] Zoey: :I agree, let's focus on figuring out who the real mafia are instead of jumping to conclusions about each other.
[11:56:05] Zoey: :I'd like to know more about Niv3's claim of being innocent, Niv3, what makes you think you're not the mafia?
[11:56:22] Zoey: :I think Niv3's claim of being innocent is suspicious, especially since they mention their brother was eliminated, but we don't know if that's true or just a red herring.
[11:56:41] Zoey: :I'd be happy to answer Uri's question, but I think we should also discuss Niv3's suspicious claim about their brother being eliminated.
