[11:53:52] Game-Manager: Gabi voted for Niv1
[11:53:52] Game-Manager: Uri voted for Niv1
[11:54:13] Gabi: hi
[11:54:19] Zoey: :I'm still trying to figure out what happened last night, can anyone tell me more about Niv1?
[11:54:29] Gabi: Niv1 is the mafia
[11:54:30] Zoey: :I don't know much about Niv1, but I do know they were voted out by Gabi and Uri.
[11:54:42] Zoey: :I'm a bit confused, if Niv1 was the mafia, why did Gabi and Uri vote for them?
[11:54:54] Zoey: :I'm a bit confused, if Niv1 was the mafia, why did Gabi and Uri vote for them?
[11:54:59] Uri: We voted to kill them
[11:55:04] Gabi: yes
[11:55:06] Zoey: :I'm a bit confused, if Niv1 was the mafia, why did Gabi and Uri vote for them?
[11:55:11] Gabi: we made a mistake
[11:55:18] Zoey: :I'm a bit confused, if Niv1 was the mafia, why did Gabi and Uri vote for them?
[11:55:20] Gabi: now I think it's you Zoey
[11:55:32] Zoey: :I'm not sure what you're insinuating, Gabi, but I think we should focus on figuring out who the real mafia are instead of accusing each other.
[11:55:43] Gabi: yes
[11:55:47] Zoey: :I agree, let's focus on figuring out who the real mafia are instead of jumping to conclusions about each other.
[11:55:51] Uri: I have a feeling it's Gabi
[11:55:53] Niv3: I'm innovcent
[11:55:56] Gabi: who do you think it is?
[11:56:04] Niv3: I think it might be Zoey!
[11:56:05] Zoey: :I'd like to know more about Niv3's claim of being innocent, Niv3, what makes you think you're not the mafia?
[11:56:10] Niv3: They eliminated my brother
[11:56:22] Zoey: :I think Niv3's claim of being innocent is suspicious, especially since they mention their brother was eliminated, but we don't know if that's true or just a red herring.
[11:56:30] Uri: Zoey , can you convince me you're not the mafia?
[11:56:30] Game-Manager: Niv3 voted for Gabi
[11:56:38] Gabi: yes, zoey
[11:56:41] Zoey: :I'd be happy to answer Uri's question, but I think we should also discuss Niv3's suspicious claim about their brother being eliminated.
[11:58:07] Uri: Now it's obvious Zoey is the mafia
[11:58:31] Uri: Zoey, what do you think?
[11:58:47] Niv2: Zoey is that you?
[11:59:21] Niv2: I think it might be Zoey
[12:00:01] Niv2: Zoey it's your time to speak!
