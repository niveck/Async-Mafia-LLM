# Async-Mafia-LLM

This is the repository for the code and data of **LLMafia**: an asynchronous environment for an LLM to play the game of Mafia with multiple human participants.

The collected data of games is available under the `games` directory.
Each game subdirectory contains files with the messages sent by all players, human and LLM, in addition to game-management messages, metadata, and each game's configuration (after being anonymized).
